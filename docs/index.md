# Battle for Midway

## Project Description

### Summary

Battle for Midway is a turn-based strategy game. The player, representing the United States will be utilizing a large host of aircraft whose objective is to ascertain the location of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and upon locating, destroy all enemy vessels. Each turn the user will dispatch the aircraft squadrons at their disposal to hunt for ships on the game board.
