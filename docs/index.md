# Battle for Midway

## Project Description

### Summary

Battle for Midway is a turn-based strategy game. The player, representing the United States will be utilizing a large host of aircraft whose objective is to ascertain the location of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and upon locating, destroy all enemy vessels. Each turn the user will dispatch the aircraft squadrons at their disposal to hunt for ships on the game board. The player has ten turns to complete the total annihilation of the Japanese fleet before they reach the United States base at Midway. If the opponent has not been defeated by turn ten, the Japanese invasion force lands on Midway and the game is lost.


### Functionality

* The game board will be setup in a grid format.
* Users will play as United States air forces in the Battle of Midway.
* Fight against the might of the Japanese navy and attempt to destroy 10 of their largest ships.
* Disperse your squadrons of aircraft to explore the board and locate the position of enemies.
* Allied fighters will be assigned to squares of the grid to reveal enemies. Once revealed commit your squadrons to fight their opponents.
* Commit your fighters, from your available pool of squadrons, to annihilate their opponents within 10 turns before they land their invasion force on Midway.
* Every turn the Japanese fleet changes its location and moves closer to the United States base at Midway.
* Players will discover historical information about the type of warfare surrounding the Pacific theater of WWII and the actors involved.

## Intended users

* People who enjoy playing strategy games.

	> As a person who grew up playing board and computer based games I want to be able to experience turn-based strategy games in new scenarios that enable me to invoke the same nostalgia I used to have growing up playing these games.

* People who are interested in history, particularly military history.

	> As someone whose favorite subject is history, I have been reading historical based content for most of my adult life. I want to be able to experience what I read about from my android device so I may immerse myself in these historical situations.

## Current Application State

While the application is in a buildable and runnable state, there is still plenty of work to be done before there is a playable game. While the layout contains three bottom navigation buttons with their own screens, they do not currently have a role, and the game logic has not been implemented.

### Not Functional

* The game in its current state
* Buttons without functionality
* Database returning games

### Stretch Goals

* Populating Screens
* Implementing Game logic
* Social Media sharing integration with API
